# Mastermind

This gem is the "Mastermind" game from "The Rspec Book" (&copy; 2009, The Pragmatic Bookshelf.)

This program is designed to teach the use of Cucumber and Rspec along with the basics
of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) through practical real world examples.

As a learning exercise I have decided to build this program out as a packageable gem
via [bundler](http://bundler.io). When and where appropriate I will be deviating from
the examples in "The Rspec Book" in order to deal with deprecated methods in the gems
used to build and/or test the program. (e.g: Changing mock() to double()).

## Installation

Clone the repository:

    $ git clone git@github.com:JamesAwesome/mastermind.git

Install required gems via bundler:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

    $ bundle exec mastermind

## Contributing

Because this is an example program I will not be accepting contributions.

Please however feel free to leave feedback. I am always happy to hear constructive
criticism. :)
